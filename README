This repository contains an implementation of a program relating working times
for distinct employees, as well as how often they have been in the office at
the same time. It was developed using python version 3.10.4.

The solution is based around 3 models which are WorkTime (represents an hour
and minute), WorkInterval (represents 2 work times, one being the start and the
other the end), and Employee (represents a person which has both a name and a
collection of WorkIntervals mapped to days of the week in which they've
worked).

For the realization of this project, the following things were taken as a
baseline:
    * Only txt files will be used.
    * Each line on the text file will have the following structure:
        NAME=DAYSTART-END,DAYSTART-END...
    * DAY is a two character string representing a day of the week in
    the following form:
        - SU
        - MO
        - TU
        - WE
        - TH
        - FR
        - SA
    * START and END are 5 character strings representing a time of the day
    on 24 hour format with a colon (:) separating them. Eg: 10:30, 00:15, 23:45
    * There are no repeated days for the same employee.
    Eg:
        ASTRID=MO10:00-12:00,MO15:00-17:00 is not valid

To execute the program, the only thing needed is to run on the root of the
project:
    python -m main

By default, the file used will be named 'data.txt', located at the root of
the project. If a different file want to be used, it can be specified running:
    python -m main FILEPATH

To execute the tests, run the following command:
    python -m unittest test
